That looks like it has the stuff I need.

vtable lookups?

symbol dumping?

It would be amusing to fuzz a binary and then run it under a suitable pintool to find instruction
sequences which confuse PIN. PIN countermeasures, if you will :)  Look for crashes that kill the PIN
tool itself, not just the program.

OP_NEWPC takes up a lot of space, it seems; maybe makes sense to only log BBL hits sometimes?

1) Scan for module map
2) Scan for BBLs
3) Scan for PC text
4) Scan for symbols
