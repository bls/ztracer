That looks like it has the stuff I need.

vtable lookups?

symbol dumping?

It would be amusing to fuzz a binary and then run it under a suitable pintool to find instruction
sequences which confuse PIN. PIN countermeasures, if you will :)  Look for crashes that kill the PIN
tool itself, not just the program.

OP_NEWPC takes up a lot of space, it seems; maybe makes sense to only log BBL hits sometimes?

1) Scan for module map
2) Scan for BBLs
3) Scan for PC text
4) Scan for symbols


Packaging
Use Vagrant for tests across platforms?

Can we check for ignored function return values?

Use after free analysis
Process object / pointer graph
Object lifecycles and state changes

Code -> object links

Add extra fields in protobufs?   Maybe it makes sense to transform the instructions etc further?
